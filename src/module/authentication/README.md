We are utilizing the database module, which handles our connections.
Our authentication mdoule provides us with the ability of creating users with bcrypted passwords.

## TODO

- [ ] Include JWT Refresh Route
- [ ] Possible long session jwt and short session to help faciliate refresh
- [ ] Include permissions on users for roles management

## Tech Debt

- [ ] Possibly refactor our users into their own module.
